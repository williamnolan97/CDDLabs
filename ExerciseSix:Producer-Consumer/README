Lab 6 - Producer-Consumer

Author: William Nolan
Licence: GNU

This Lab demonstrates a 2 classes a producer and consumer working on a thread safe buffer using semaphores.
The producer generates random characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’ at random intervals (between 0 and 1 second in length).
It adds these to a thread safe buffer that has a finite holding capacity of N characters. It generates a preset number of
characters (determined at runtime) and when it has finished it add an ‘X’ character to the buffer and exits. The consumer
takes these letters from the buffer at random time intervals (between 0 and 1 second in length) and records how many of
each letter it consumes. Once it sees an ‘X’ in the buffer it adds its character count to a central buffer and exits.
